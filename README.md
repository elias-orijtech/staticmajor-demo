## Staticmajor GitHub Action demo

This repository has a [workflow](https://github.com/elias-orijtech/staticmajor-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/staticmajor.yml)
set up that runs the staticmajor Go analyzer on a code snippet with a [leak](https://github.com/elias-orijtech/staticmajor-demo/blob/main/leak/leak.go).
Visit the [Actions](https://github.com/elias-orijtech/staticmajor-demo/actions) page to see the output from the analyzer.

Run staticmajor yourself by copying the workflow or following [the instructions](https://github.com/orijtech/staticmajor-action).
